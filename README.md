### Contents

This repository contains the scripts corresponding to my lectures in the course *Product Design And Development* for the Master of Engineering *Integrated Design and Engineering* at University of Bath. 

 * Lecture 8. Sustainability and Eco-design. In progress.
 * Lecture 9. System thinking. To do.
 * Lecture 10. Design theory. To do.
 * Lecture 11. Future trends in NPD. To do. 

### Legend
In each script, you will see:
- emphasised expressions followed by an asterisk (e.g. "*sustainability* *"): these are important concepts which are defined later in the lecture. This format is used the first time the expression appears and in the "take-aways"
- references to slides (e.g. "[Slide 12]" written in blue). Slides are not provided in this repository for the moment (as long as I haven't checked the copyrights)
- take-aways at the end of each section, summarizing in short simplified sentences the content of the section
