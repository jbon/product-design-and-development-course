### Contents

This repository contains the scripts of my lectures within the module *Product Design And Development* (Master of Engineering *Integrated Design and Engineering*) at University of Bath. This is work in progress and I will add lectures gradually. For now, available contents are:
 * Lecture 08. [Sustainability and Eco-design](08. Sustainability and eco-design/Script8.pdf).
 * Lecture 09. [System thinking (in progress)](09. System thinking/Script9.pdf)
 * Lecture 10. [Design theory](10. Design theory/Script10.pdf).
 * Lecture 11. [Future trends in NPD](11. Future of NPD/Script11.pdf). 


### Legend
Each script contains:
- an abstract summarizing the overall intention of the lecture. 
- "take-aways" at the end of each section: these are short and simplified sentences summarizing the contents of the section.

I also use specific formatting features:
- Important concepts are written in italic and followed by an asterisk (e.g. "*sustainability* *"). This format is used the first time the expression appears and in the "take-aways". These important concepts are listed as keywords behind the abstract at the begining of the document. 
- References to lecture slides are written in blue like this "[Slide 12]". Slides are not provided in this repository for the moment (as long as I haven't checked the copyrights for the pictures I use).
- References to key readings are identified with a magenta superscript notice "[key reading]" after a citation. Key readings are documents wh\ich to my opinion give a good entry points to go into more depth.

### Got a proposition for improvement?

I wrote all scripts in LaTeX so it is compatible with an *open-source-like* edition process. If you have any proposition for improvement, please don't hesitate to:
* create an issue
* fork and create a pull request
