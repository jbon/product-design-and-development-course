  abstract = {Design principles are created to codify and formalize design knowledge so that innovative, archival practices may be communicated and used to advance design science and solve future design problems, especially the pinnacle, wicked, and grand-challenge problems that face the world and cross-cutting markets. Principles are part of a family of knowledge explication, which also include guidelines, heuristics, rules of thumb, and strategic constructs. Definitions of a range of explications are explored from a number of seminal papers. Based on this analysis, the authors pose formalized definitions for the three most prevalent terms in the literature\textemdash{}principles, guidelines, and heuristics\textemdash{}and draw more definitive distinctions between the terms. Current research methods and practices with design principles are categorized and characterized. We further explore research methodologies, validation approaches, semantic principle composition through computational analysis, and a proposed formal approach to articulating principles. In analyzing the methodology for discovering, deriving, formulating, and validating design principles, the goal is to understand and advance the theoretical basis of design, the foundations of new tools and techniques, and the complex systems of the future. Suggestions for the future of design principles research methodology for added rigor and repeatability are proposed.},

  abstract = {Research supports the central role cognitive strategies can play in successful concept generation by individual designers. Design heuristics have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12 industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the designers' sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the problem for 25~min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience, environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design domains.},

This paper investigates designers' approaches when selecting inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process. We conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design Masters students while generating ideas for a design problem. The results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require different levels of cognitive effort, depending on whether there is unlimited or limited access to stimuli. Furthermore, three important stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition, stimuli search and stimuli selection. For each of these stages, we elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they use and what drives their selection of stimuli. This paper contributes to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their inspiration process in a more detailed manner.},

  isbn = {978-1-84628-318-5},
  shorttitle = {Engineering {{Design}}},
  abstract = {Engineering design must be carefully planned and systematically executed. In particular, engineering design methods must integrate the many different aspects of designing and the priorities of the end-user. Engineering Design (3rd edition) describes a systematic approach to engineering design. The authors argue that such an approach, applied flexibly and adapted to a particular task, is essential for successful product development. The design process is first broken down into phases and then into distinct steps, each with its own working methods. The third edition of this internationally-recognised text is enhanced with new perspectives and the latest thinking. These include extended treatment of product planning; new sections on organisation structures, simultaneous engineering, leadership and team behaviour; and updated chapters on quality methods and estimating costs. New examples have been added and existing ones extended, with additions on design to minimise wear, design for recycling, mechanical connections, mechatronics, and adaptronics. Engineering Design (3rd edition) is translated and edited from the sixth German edition by Ken Wallace, Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Cambridge, and Luci\"enne Blessing, Professor of Engineering Design and Methodology at the Technical University of Berlin. Topics covered include: fundamentals; product planning and product development; task clarification and conceptual design; embodiment design rules, principles and guidelines; mechanical connections, mechatronics and adaptronics; size ranges and modular products; quality methods; and cost estimation methods. The book provides a comprehensive guide to successful product development for practising designers, students, and design educators. Fundamentals are emphasised throughout and short-term trends avoided; so the approach described provides a sound basis for design courses that help students move quickly and effectively into design practice. Engineering Design is widely acknowledged to be the most complete available treatise on systematic design methods. In it, each step of the engineering design process and associated best practices are documented. The book has particularly strong sections on design from the functional perspective and on the phase of the process between conceptual and detail design in which most key design decisions are made. The 3rd edition includes new material on project planning and scheduling. Anyone committed to understanding the design process should be familiar with the contents of this book.

This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader `open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to `open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization.

Use of water and elemental gases (mainly N2) in the fabrication stage are 32\,000 and 700 g per chip, respectively. The production chain yielding silicon wafers from quartz uses 160 times the energy required for typical silicon, indicating that purification to semiconductor grade materials is energy intensive. Due to its extremely low-entropy, organized structure, the materials intensity of a microchip is orders of magnitude higher than that of ``traditional'' goods. Future analysis of semiconductor and other low entropy high-tech goods needs to include the use of secondary materials, especially for purification.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.09.009},
  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is essential for crop growth and food production, and most of the phosphorus applied to agricultural land comes from phosphate rock (PR), a non-renewable resource. The distribution of PR reserves and the share of current production are both concentrated in a handful of countries, notably Morocco and China. Individual countries operate their phosphate mining industries at different reserve-to-production (R/P) ratios, which determines the lifetime of PR reserves in that country and, in turn, the global distribution of both reserves and production in the future. This research uses U.S. Geological Survey data (released in January 2011) to derive R/P ratios for individual countries and combines this with a scenario for increasing global demand to investigate how the global distribution of PR reserves and production will change between now and the year 2100. The results show that 70\% of global production is currently produced from reserves which will be depleted within 100 years and combining this with increasing demand will result in a significant global production deficit, which by 2070 will be larger than current production. Morocco, with nearly 77\% of global reserves, will need to increase production by around 700\% by 2075 in order to meet most of this deficit. If this is possible, Morocco will obtain a much greater share of worldwide production, from around 15\% in 2010 to around 80\% by 2100, which implies more control over market prices. Also, since Morocco operates the highest R/P ratio throughout the analysis period, its share of the global reserves continues to increase, from 77\% in 2011 to 89\% by 2100. Overall, the research concludes that, unless additional sources of phosphorus can be accessed or society can significantly increase phosphorus recycling, future global phosphorus security will be increasingly reliant on a single country.},

  abstract = {[ABSTRACT. Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO$_{2}$ concentration in the atmosphere $<$350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite $\geq$ 80\% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ($<$5\% reduction in O$_{3}$ concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N$_{2}$ to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ($<$4000 km$^3$ yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ($<$15\% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of $<$10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social\textendash{}ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of ``planetary boundaries'' lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the ``planetary playing field'' for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.]},

For IMPACT 2002+, new concepts and methods have been developed, especially for the comparative assessment of human toxicity and ecotoxicity. Human Damage Factors are calculated for carcinogens and non-carcinogens, employing intake fractions, best estimates of dose-response slope factors, as well as severities. The transfer of contaminants into the human food is no more based on consumption surveys, but accounts for agricultural and livestock production levels. Indoor and outdoor air emissions can be compared and the intermittent character of rainfall is considered. Both human toxicity and ecotoxicity effect factors are based on mean responses rather than on conservative assumptions. Other midpoint categories are adapted from existing characterizing methods (Eco-indicator 99 and CML 2002). All midpoint scores are expressed in units of a reference substance and related to the four damage categories human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and resources. Normalization can be performed either at midpoint or at damage level. The IMPACT 2002+ method presently provides characterization factors for almost 1500 different LCI-results, which can be downloaded at http://www.epfl.ch/impact},

  abstract = {The most important moment in product development is when demands and specifications are decided for the product that is being planned. The specification defines the goal for the product development process. It is a very important steering opportunity for the continuing work and for environmentally driven demands that are to be addressed in the product development phase. The designers are said to have the key to sustainable product development through EcoDesign. Many tools have been developed in order to help them to achieve this objective. However, most tools are seldom used primarily because of a lack of sustainability oriented requirements in specifications for products. If there is no demand for improved environmental performance, then there is no need for EcoDesign tools. The lack of market demand for environmentally improved products is therefore, a crucial factor. In other words: It makes no sense to grab a screwdriver from your toolbox if you have a nail in your hand. On the other hand if you have a hammer in your hand you tend to see everything as nails! The hypothesis of this paper is that there is a strong need for a tool to facilitate the integration of reasonable environmental demands into the product development process. The presented tool, ``The Ten Golden Rules,'' can be helpful in this effort. A helpful tool must be well adapted to the task and therefore it is important that the individual product developer/designer can develop personal versions from the generic guidelines. The Ten Golden Rules provide such a possibility. They provide a common foundation, for all in the team, which can be used as a base and guidelines for development of situation specific product-design challenges.},

In response, product designers seek simple and effective methods for lowering the environmental footprints of their concepts. Design for environment (DfE) is a field of product design methodology that includes tools, methods, and principles to help designers reduce environmental impact. The most powerful and well-known tool for DfE is life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA requires a fully specified design, however, which makes it applicable primarily at the end of the design process. Because the decisions with the greatest environmental impact are made during early design stages when data for a comprehensive LCA are not yet available, it is important to develop DfE tools that can be implemented in the early conceptual and embodiment design stages. Based on a broad critical review of DfE literature and best practices, a set of 76 DfE guidelines are compiled and reconciled for use in early stage design of products with minimal environmental impact. Select guidelines are illustrated through examples, and several strategies for using the guidelines are introduced.},

This paper studies the design guidelines from Design for X which provides directional criteria on designing for multiple generation life-cycles. Therefore, in this paper, Design for Multiple Life-Cycles is defined as a combination of eco-design strategies including Design for Environment and Design for Remanufacture, which leads to other design strategies such as Design for Upgrade, Design for Assembly, Design for Disassembly, Design for Modularity, Design for Maintainability and Design for Reliability. This multiple life-cycles design thinking will pave the way for a more sustainable design and development of future products.},

However, this assumption has not been systematically tested. This research attempted to quantify the life cycle environmental benefits achieved by incorporating remanufacturing into a product system, based on a study of Xerox photocopiers in Australia. The study found that remanufacturing can reduce resource consumption and waste generation over the life cycle of a photocopier by up to a factor of 3, with greatest reductions if a product is designed for disassembly and remanufacturing.

Dagens storskaliga tillverkning baseras p\aa{} varor med relativt kort livstid och l\aa{}gt pris. Vinsterna f\"or tillverkarna kommer fr\aa{}n den stora m\"angden s\aa{}lda varor. Det finns dock inom m\aa{}nga industribranscher krympande vinstmarginaler och m\aa{}nga f\"oretag s\"oker d\"arf\"or efter nya k\"allor f\"or att uppn\aa{} b\"attre r\"orelseresultat. \"Aven milj\"ofr\aa{}gorna \"ar en utmaning f\"or industrin. V\"axande milj\"oproblem leder till krav p\aa{} att milj\"op\aa{}verkan fr\aa{}n varorna minskas och att producenternas ansvar f\"or de tillverkade varorna \"okas. \AA{} andra sidan \"ager dagens konsumenter ett v\"axande antal varor som anv\"ands f\"orh\aa{}llandevis s\"allan. Privatpersoner forts\"atter ofta att anv\"anda samma varor \"aven n\"ar nya mer effektiva modeller dyker upp, eftersom de inte st\"andigt kan k\"opa nya saker. Eftersom priserna \"ar h\"ogre kan man m\aa{}nga g\aa{}nger inte heller k\"opa de mest milj\"oanpassade alternativen, \"aven om dessa ofta \"aven har ergonomiska och kvalitetsf\"ordelar.$<$br/$><$br$>$

Denna avhandling studerar m\"ojligheterna f\"or att utveckla ett nytt s\aa{} kallat produktservice-system, som i motsats till \"overl\aa{}telse av den materiella varan fokuserar f\"ors\"aljning av funktionen (funktionsf\"ors\"aljning). Det f\"orv\"antas att ett s\aa{}dant system kan leda till avsev\"arda milj\"of\"orb\"attringar \"over varans livscykel. Avhandlingen samlar in erfarenheter fr\aa{}n f\"oretag som redan anv\"ander funktionsf\"ors\"aljning som aff\"arsmodell samt unders\"oker drivkrafter och hinder f\"or en vidareutveckling av den nya aff\"arsmodellen. Dessutom studeras de politiska styrmedel och samh\"allsinstitutioner, som kan st\"odja s\aa{}dana mer h\aa{}llbara produktions- och konsumtionsm\"onster. Avhandlingen bygger p\aa{} en fallstudie av tv\aa{} varor (gr\"asklippare och borrmaskiner) f\"or vilka scenarier f\"or funktionsf\"ors\"aljning utvecklas. Scenarierna bygger p\aa{} ett f\"or\"andrat \"agandef\"orh\aa{}llande f\"or varan (i stil med bilpooler) och visar att detta p\aa{}verkar storleken och hastigheten f\"or materialfl\"odena i samh\"allet.

$<$br/$><$br$>$
I avhandlingen diskuteras samh\"alliga och f\"oretagsrelaterade faktorer som p\aa{}verkar milj\"oprofilen f\"or ett produktservice-system. Avslutningsvis dras slutsatsen att produktservice-system har en intressant milj\"opotential, som dock beror p\aa{} systemets uppbyggnad s\aa{}v\"al som p\aa{} det sociokulturella sammanhanget. Avhandlingen ger f\"orhoppningsvis svenskt n\"aringsliv unik kunskap kring funktionsf\"ors\"aljning, som \"aven kan utnyttjas i ett st\"orre sammanhang och fr\"amja framv\"axten av nya f\"oretag.},

SusProNet, an EU network on PSSs, showed a more complicated reality. At least eight different types of PSS exist, with quite diverging economic and environmental characteristics. The economic potential of each type was evaluated in terms of (i) tangible and intangible value for the user, (ii) tangible costs and risk premium for the provider, (iii) capital/investment needs and (iv) issues such as the providers' position in the value chain and client relations. The environmental potential was evaluated by checking the relevance of certain impact reduction mechanisms (e.g. more intensive use of capital goods, inherent incentives for sustainable user and provider behaviour etc.). Most PSS types will result in marginal environmental improvements at best. The exception is the PSS type known as functional results, but here liability and risk premium issues, amongst others, need a solution.

  abstract = {In this paper `innovation' is discussed as a strategy to change consumer behaviour to reduce the environmental impact of consumption. Innovation aims to improve the `production process' of certain end results or `units of service' for the consumer, which is defined as the `consumption technology'. This concept includes the entire organization of how these units of service are produced. `Eco-efficient services' are introduced as an innovation strategy, based on theoretical considerations through which more eco-efficient consumption technologies and less environmentally damaging consumption behaviour could be realized. This strategy is explored through an empirical consumer behaviour study on commercial car sharing services in the Netherlands. Based on an inventory of the environmental effects of this approach, as exemplified by the car sharing schemes, it can tentatively be concluded that the eco-efficient services concept offers an interesting framework for reconsidering the current consumption practice and for generating innovative activities in industry. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a model for design exploration based on notions of evolution and demonstrates computational co-evolution using a modified genetic algorithm (GA). Evolution is extended to consider co-evolution where two systems evolve in response to each other. Co-evolution in design exploration supports the change, over time, of the design solution and the design requirements. The basic GA, which does not support our exploration model, evaluates individuals from a population of design solutions with an unchanged fitness function. This approach to evaluation implements search with a prefixed goal. Modifications to the basic GA are required to support exploration. Two approaches to implement a co-evolving GA are: a combined gene approach and a separate spaces approach. The combined gene approach includes the representation of the requirements and the solution within the genotype. The separate spaces approach models the requirements and the solutions as separately evolving interacting populations of genotypes. The combined gene approach is developed further in this paper and used to demonstrate design exploration in the domain of braced frame design for buildings. The issues related to the coding of the genotype, mapping to a phenotype, and evaluation of the phenotype are addressed. Preliminary results of co-evolution are presented that show how exploration differs from search.},

We propose a typology of co-creation activities in order to develop conceptual arguments how social media can impact the relationships among customers involved in co-creation as well as the relationship between customers and the hosting firm. Social media can make economic-exchange relations more collaborative and social, but interestingly may also turn relations formerly based on social-exchange into "money markets" with strong competition among actors.

  abstract = {Annotation In today's information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation--which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies--is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, "open innovation," which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the author's own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley. Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms, Open Innovationshows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R \& D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business. Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a company's ideas and technologies.

While the word means different things to different people, it can generally be described as the use of social computing technologies, tools, and media, influencing the product life cycle at any stage through the use of a defined and qualified crowd with the goal of enhancing the value of communication. Some of the tenants of Social Product Development are crowdsourcing, mass collaboration, open innovation, and cloud-based design and manufacturing. Social Product Development can be categorized into Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 technologies, the distinction being whether the technologies are used to interface with internal (Web 2.0) or external (Enterprise 2.0) entities from the product development enterprise. While the extent of use of these technologies has not been fully characterized yet, there are many examples of their use in industry and their successful results. From these examples, we are able to draw some conclusions about how to successfully implement these technologies into a product development venture. Even as we try to understand how to utilize Social Product Development in its current state, it is important to look toward the future and analyze how the Internet, which makes Social Product Development possible, is changing as to determine how Social Product Development principles will change with it.},

With introduction of cheap three-dimensional printers, the direct digital manufacturing seems to become a new manufacturing paradigm with an entirely different impact on society; nevertheless how this will impact the society and the differences between the paradigms are unclear. According to this background, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of direct digital manufacturing from different perspectives in comparison to various traditional manufacturing paradigms. Authors are using a societal viewpoint to see, describe and analyse the subject instead of traditional manufacturing viewpoint. For the better understanding of direct digital manufacturing origins, a classification and historical background about available techniques are described. Furthermore, direct digital manufacturing as a paradigm is analysed and compared with craft production, mass production and mass customisation. Direct digital manufacturing's sustainability aspects related to social, economical and environmental dimensions are gathered and analysed for a better insight of this technique. A detailed case study demonstrates the energy use differences of direct digital manufacturing and mass production in depth. According to the present work, direct digital manufacturing has the possibility of combining the advantages of the other production paradigms and can have a positive impact on sustainable development; yet, there are several challenges to overcome both in technical and sociality aspects. A challenge within the social aspects can be the life style changes which can impact the job market, working environment, waste management and more.},
