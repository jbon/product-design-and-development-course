Les Ressourceries ont pour vocation de donner une plus-value environnementale, sociale et {\'e}conomique {\`a} l'activit{\'e} de r{\'e}emploi. Leurs quatre roles sont de \textbf{collecter}, \textbf{valoriser }et \textbf{redistribuer}, tout en \textbf{sensibilisant }le citoyens et usagers. Elles promeuvent une vision pr{\'e}ventive du d{\'e}chet, par opposition {\`a} une vision gestionnaire : r{\'e}duction {\`a} la source, durabilit{\'e} des produits, cycles courts et locaux.

Le r{\'e}seau capitalise les exp{\'e}riences des diff{\'e}rents ressourceries, et publie des guides pour la formation de nouvelles structures. Il propose {\'e}galement des formations pour tous les acteurs des ressourceries : techniciens, responsables de structures, responsables d'entreprise ou de collectivit{\'e}s.

Lesressourceries apportent des solutions de proximit{\'e} innovantes {\`a} un probl{\`e}me g{\'e}n{\'e}ralement abord{\'e} selon une logique gestionnaire (avec indicateurs et tout et tout), des solutions qui, de par leur \textbf{l{\'e}gitimit{\'e} }locale, peuvent accompagner le citoyen vers des changements de comportements.

We estimate this previously unmeasured type of household sector innovation to be quite large: 6.1\% of UK consumers\textemdash{}nearly 2.9 million individuals\textemdash{}have engaged in consumer product innovation during the prior three years. In aggregate, consumers' annual product development expenditures are more than 1.4 times larger than the annual consumer product R\&D expenditures of all firms in the United Kingdom combined. Consumers engage in many small projects that seem complementary to the innovation efforts of incumbent producers. Consumer innovators very seldom protect their innovations via intellectual property, and 17\% diffuse to others. These results imply that, at the country level, productivity studies yield inflated effect sizes for producer innovation in consumer goods. They also imply that existing companies should reconfigure their product development systems to find and build on prototypes developed by consumers.

  abstract = {The rise of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology as a driver of rural electrification in the developing world and a contributor to climate change mitigation suggests that innovations enhancing PV efficiency and scalability could make considerable strides in reducing both poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for a renewable energy source to accelerate sustainable development. Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of open-source design have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development; however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate innovation.},

L'article donne bonne \textbf{vue d'ensemble }des concepts autour de l'open design, en partant de l'open source jusqu'{\`a} l'utilisation de l'open design en industrie, et {\'e}non{\c c}ant des \textbf{d{\'e}finitions }claires. L'auteur souligne que le concept d'open source n'est pas nouveau, puisqu'il est inscrit dans la logique acad{\'e}mique de recherche scientifique. Cel{\`a} dit, il a {\'e}t{\'e} mis au gout du jour pour la premi{\`e}re fois dans une autre discipline gr{\^a}ce {\`a} l'informatique, et r{\'e}action radicale {\`a} l'appropriation de cette nouvelle technologie par la recherhce du profit. Outre un int{\'e}r{\^e}t social(iste), l'open source a un int{\'e}r{\^e}t en terme d'innovation : "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" (The cathedral and the bazaar, Raymond). Dans un monde participatif et ouvert, l'innovation devient triviale, en contraste avec un monde ferm{\'e} r{\'e}gi par un syst{\`e}mes de protection de la propri{\'e}t{\'e} intellectuelle qui \textbf{freine l'innovation}.

~

L'auteur souligne que \textbf{caract{\'e}ristiques }ont {\'e}t{\'e} \textbf{essentielles }au succ{\`e}s de l'open source :

\begin{itemize}

\item la culture du don et de la r{\'e}ciprocit{\'e}: "j'utilise qqch qui a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e} gratuitement par qqn et en retour je me dois de produire qqch"

\item la cr{\'e}ation d'une communaut{\'e} active, vivante {\`a} l'esprit "hacker" (qui rel{\`e}vent des d{\'e}fis techniques pour le plaisir et la reconnaissance [communautaire ou porfessionnelle])

\item la modularit{\'e} de l'objet {\`a} cr{\'e}er et donc la possibilit{\'e} de partager les t{\^a}ches. Ici on retrouve le besoin, exprim{\'e} par Howard (et McAloone), que la communaut{\'e} open design trouve son sourceforge

\end{itemize}

Les \textbf{avantages }de l'open design peuvent-{\^e}tre:

\begin{itemize}

\item rapidit{\'e} de d{\'e}veloppement

\item co{\^u}ts de d{\'e}veloppement r{\'e}duits

\item propagation rapide des derni{\`e}res technologies et meilleures pratiques

\end{itemize}

Les \textbf{inconv{\'e}nients }:

\begin{itemize}

\item utilisation des donn{\'e}es partag{\'e}es par les concurrents

\item r{\'e}duit les barri{\`e}res {\`a} l'entr{\'e}e du {\"o}arch\ss{}e pourles start-ups

\end{itemize}

L'article explore diff{\'e}rents buisiness models "ouverts", mais seulement entre entreprises partenaires ou concurentes dans une chaine de valeur. Il pr{\'e}sente quatre mod{\`e}les : partenariats, franchise, collabiration entre co-fournisseurs, compl{\`e}tement ouvert. Cette exploration soul{\`e}ve le besoin d'une action de la part des autorit{\'e}s publiques afin de favoriser l'{\'e}mergence de ce type de mod{\`e}les.

Companies are also beginning to utilize the power of mass collaboration to foster innovation at various levels. Business models based on mass collaboration are also emerging. Such an environment of mass collaboration brings about significant opportunities and challenges for designing next generation products. The objectives in this paper are to discuss these recent developments in the context of engineering design and to identify new research challenges. The recent trends in mass collaboration are discussed and the impacts of these trends on product realization processes are presented. Traditional collaborative product realization is distinguished from mass collaborative product realization. Finally, the open research issues for successful implementation of mass collaborative product realization are discussed.},

\textbf{Principes de base de l'open source}

\textbf{4 principes }du "open" : libert{\'e} d'utiliser, {\'e}tudier, modifier et redistribuer.

\textbf{2 r{\`e}gles} : le do-it-yourself (qu{\^e}te d'autonomie individuelle) et la mutualisation organis{\'e}e (la notion de r{\'e}ciprocit{\'e} est notamment importante [voire d'{\'e}conomie du don?]).\\
concept de \textbf{forge}: ateliers virtuels

Diff{\'e}rence entre \textbf{free software} et\textbf{ open source}: les premiers sont utopistes et port{\'e}s par un id{\'e}al social, les seconds sont pragmatiques et revendiquent la sup{\'e}riorit{\'e} organisationnelle de la conception ouverte sur la conception ferm{\'e}e (sup{\'e}riorit{\'e} illustr{\'e}e par la c{\'e}l{\`e}bre citation de Raymond que l'auteur traduit par "{\'e}tant donn{\'e} suffisamment d'observateurs, tous les bogues sautent aux yeux").\textbf{}

\textbf{Le versant politique de la question}

La "\textbf{micro-informatique}" est n{\'e}e du m{\^e}me mouvement de "bricolage" que l'on observe aujourd'hui autour des imprimantes 3D, en r{\'e}action {\`a} l'informatique tout d'abord centralis{\'e}e et uniquement au service de l'arm{\'e}e, des gouvernements et des grandes entreprises - une informatique {\`a} ses d{\'e}buts per{\c c}ue comme un instrument d'opression et de contr{\^o}le social -,et de la revendication d'une lib{\'e}ration de l'informatique pour l'usage personnel.

Le "mythe" de Stallman (p12) illustre la cr{\'e}ation d'un mouvement en r{\'e}action contre une logique commerciale qui freine l'\textbf{innovation }(sur ce point voir Buitenhuis). Le mouvement du lobre se pose en garant de l'\textbf{autonomie }de l'utilisateur. Il ne se positionne pas contre la logique commerciale, mais contre l'\textbf{exclusion }de l'utilisateur. L'euteur parle de "\textbf{d{\'e}prol{\'e}tarisation}", de pratique \textbf{d{\'e}sali{\'e}n{\'e}e }par le maintient du lien entre conception et usage.

La communaut{\'e} du libre permet de reg{\'e}n{\'e}rer le\textbf{ r{\^e}ve communautariste} des ann{\'e}es 60 (avec ses exp{\'e}rimentations communautaristes, qui ont fini par {\^e}tre largement abandonn{\'e}es).Le terme de communaut{\'e} (en ce qui concerne le mouvement du libre), doit {\^e}tre vu avec circonspection: est-ce une Gesellschaft (ensemble de relations impersonnelles r{\'e}sultant de l'int{\'e}r{\^e}t des individus) ou une Gemeinschaft (ensemble d'individus r{\'e}gis par un certaine affectivit{\'e}). Ce mouvement r{\'e}actualise la conduite \textbf{anti-consum{\'e}riste}, connus d{\`e}s les ann{\'e}es 60, en r{\'e}action contre une soci{\'e}t{\'e} entrainant prol{\'e}tarisation et d{\'e}pendance de la population expropri{\'e}e de ses savoir-faire traditionnels et emp{\^e}ch{\'e}e dans ses liens de solidarit{\'e}. Dans cette logique, la surconsommation mat{\'e}rielle est vue comme un moyen de d{\'e}possession de la comp{\'e}tence technique, et le mouvement pr{\^o}ne l'\textbf{optimisation }du mat{\'e}riel existant et le \textbf{recyclage}.

Le mouvement du libre r{\'e}actualise {\'e}galement la figure de l'\textbf{autodidacte}. Il organise une \textbf{do-cratie}, ou les faiseurs sont oppos{\'e}s aux consommateurs, les premiers d{\'e}cidant de l'orientation du mouvement (Deporter cite dans "logiciel libre et utopie": "tu as le droit d'{\^e}tre ce que tu as la force d'{\^e}tre"). Il est conscient du lien entre \textbf{connaissance et autorit{\'e}}: celui qui sait faire tient la barre. On pourrait donc voir dans ce mouvement une reconduction dans le cahmp de la comp{\'e}tence d'une logique lib{\'e}rale. Mais en insistant sur la capitalisation des connaissances, sur la socialisation des moyens et sur le droit au \emph{fork}, ce mouvement se donne une dimension progressiste.

\textbf{Qui sont les participants?}

Majoritairement jeunes (moins de 35 ans), classe moyenne ou populaire, form{\'e}s ($>$bac+3), mais aussi des marginaux, tous en qu{\^e}te de d'appartenance (qualit{\'e} "refuge" de la communaut{\'e}) de reconnaissance (combattre la frustration de passer sa vie {\`a} {\'e}crire anonymement du code), de sens (politique, socialiste), de comp{\'e}tence (maintien d'un r{\'e}seau de coll{\`e}gues {\'e}parpill{\'e}s dans l'espace), et de plaisir (passion pour la technique).

\textbf{Autres}

Une illustration des \textbf{changements }que les \textbf{TIC }apportent {\`a} notre vie (Loerincik) : elle transforme le monde salarial en changeant les formes d'organisation du travail et en participant {\`a} l'acc{\'e}l{\'e}ration de la vie {\'e}conomique dont elle constitue le principal dynamisant depuis les ann{\'e}es 90 (cf Plepys). Elle s'inscrit dans la p{\'e}r{\'e}nisation de la domination du capitalisme. Le milieu professionnel de l'informatique est lui m{\^e}me un des arch{\'e}types de cette forme pouss{\'e}e de capitalisme.

Parall{\`e}lement, ce mouvelent tend {\`a} contster et {\'e}branler l'ordre industriel, exp{\'e}rimentent... autre chose.}

This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing some of the trade-offs between openness to external value creation and closedness for internal value capture. It focuses on selective openness as a key variable and investigates how it affects value creation by external complementors, specifically the members of user innovation communities. Openness, it is hypothesized, matters to community members: The more open a product design is, the higher their sense of involvement in the innovation project, and the larger the effort they devote to it. Unlike prior literature, different forms and loci of openness are distinguished, specifically the transparency, accessibility, and replicability of different components of the product being developed. Hypotheses are tested based on survey data (n\,=\,309) from 20 online communities in the consumer electronics and information technology hardware industries. Multilevel regression analysis is used to account for clustering, and thus nonindependent data, at the community level. We find that openness indeed increases community members' involvement in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of openness strongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that, at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal value capture is softer than hitherto understood. Contingency factors that may be able to explain these patterns are advanced. For example, users are expected to value the form of openness that they have the capabilities and incentives to exploit. The findings in this paper extend the literature on selective openness in innovation. They emphasize the need to study the demand for different forms of openness at the subsystem level and align supply-side strategies to it. In managerial practice, a careful assessment of the demand for openness enables firms to successfully use selective openness and to effectively appropriate value from selectively open systems.},

  abstract = {One of the hot topics currently in manufacturing domain is direct digital manufacturing. With introduction of cheap three-dimensional printers, the direct digital manufacturing seems to become a new manufacturing paradigm with an entirely different impact on society; nevertheless how this will impact the society and the differences between the paradigms are unclear. According to this background, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of direct digital manufacturing from different perspectives in comparison to various traditional manufacturing paradigms. Authors are using a societal viewpoint to see, describe and analyse the subject instead of traditional manufacturing viewpoint. For the better understanding of direct digital manufacturing origins, a classification and historical background about available techniques are described. Furthermore, direct digital manufacturing as a paradigm is analysed and compared with craft production, mass production and mass customisation. Direct digital manufacturing's sustainability aspects related to social, economical and environmental dimensions are gathered and analysed for a better insight of this technique. A detailed case study demonstrates the energy use differences of direct digital manufacturing and mass production in depth. According to the present work, direct digital manufacturing has the possibility of combining the advantages of the other production paradigms and can have a positive impact on sustainable development; yet, there are several challenges to overcome both in technical and sociality aspects. A challenge within the social aspects can be the life style changes which can impact the job market, working environment, waste management and more.},

  abstract = {Designers have a key role in adapting products to the environment and a sustainable society and many attempts have been made to establish universal DfE guidelines that can be used for these design situations. However, most attempts have failed due to the level of information; too generic makes no sense for the user, and too specific means that the guidelines are too private to be useful for everyone. Furthermore, designers and the acquisition department as well as marketing and production have different background knowledge and different primary tasks. Depending on the complexity and type of product as well as on the cultural background in different companies and countries, the product development process looks different. It is therefore impossible to establish generic DfE guidelines that are valid for any product in any company. The 10 Golden Rules are a set of generic Design for Environment aspects (first presented by Luttropp (2000)). The ``10 Golden Rules'' are broad principles, which establish a common basis for a product development team, giving the team members a mutual perspective on the sustainability issue. The 10 Golden Rules are preferably individually customized to be of most use in direct design and product development process. This paper presents the customisation of the 10 Golden Rules at Bombardier Transportation, which is one of the worlds leading companies manufacturing rail vehicles.},

\item description du passage progressif du paradigme de production de masse, dans lequel le producteur et l'utilisateur sont d{\'e}connect{\'e}s, {\`a} l'open design (p110-111).

\item d{\'e}finition orient{\'e}e business de l'open design (p111)

The argumentation is accompanied by the description of a project commissioned by the NECTA Vending Solutions (the European leader of drinks \&amp; food vending machines) to the DIS research unit (Design and Innovation for environmental Sustainability, Politecnico di Milano University \textendash{} The DIS research unit of Politecnico di Milano University is offering, since 10 years, applied researches and company consulting on Life Cycle Design and eco-efficiency improvement. Typical consulting activities are: Life Cycle Assessment; handbook for LCD and eco-efficient product, service and product-service system development; procedure and tools to integrate environmental requirements into company existing product, service and product-service system development process; courses on LCD), resulting in such tools, currently integrated into the company product development process. The considerations are based upon on primary data and experiences.

The final results of this project are two handbooks of guidelines and checklists for the eco-efficient development of two types of vending machines: one for Snack \&amp; Food (spirals model), the other for Hot \&amp; Cold drinks.

In order to achieve these results an LCA has been developed and a system to prioritize guidelines has been adopted; this system has led to a procedure which moves from general to specific guidelines and checklist. Finally these tools have been integrated within the company procedure.

The method adopted by DIS in this applied research is described, highlighting the observed key success factors in a project between a University research unit and a company.

Final considerations expand upon the matured experiences to demonstrate the importance and efficacy to go from general methods and tools to more specific ones (e.g. specific guidelines and checklist), in order to implement Life Cycle Design principles, in the real company practices and culture.},

La grosse diff{\'e}rence entre les deux r{\'e}side dans le ... manufacturing : alors que dans l'open source on peut facilement fabriquer le produit final par compilation, il est plus difficile de manufacturer un produit m{\'e}canique {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle d'une personne. Le d{\'e}veloppement du home manufacturing et des MAAS (manufacturing as a service) peut renverser la tendance. A la diff{\'e}rence de l'open source, la fabrication est une {\'e}tape o{\`u} les entreprises peuvent encore avoir des opportunit{\'e}s de profit. Les entreprises initiatrices de projets open peuvent par exemple b{\'e}n{\'e}ficier d'une grande confiance et donc d'un march{\'e} bien que leur produit peut {\^e}tre copi{\'e} {\`a} vau-l'eau.

"Open design is waiting for its very own SourceForge": les contributeurs d'open design travaillent chacun de leur cot{\'e} et partagent leur r{\'e}sultats, mais ne travaillent pas ensemble sur un projet commun: ils travaillent sur des part et pas des assembly! Il y un manque d'une r{\'e}elle plateforme de collaboration (genre PLM) pour s'accorder sur une spec, spe artager le travail et g{\'e}re les configuraiton, et enfin valider les designs.

\textbf{Open Design et PSS}

Comme l'open design consiste {\`a} publier la conception d'un produit - ce qui {\'e}quivaut {\`a} un suicide pour les entreprises car les donn{\'e}es produit sont pour beaucoup d'entre elles des donn{\'e}es dont le secret est vital - il est n{\'e}cessaire pour les entreprises de trouver des business models alternatifs, comme par exemple les PSS! Des business models qui tirent leur valeur d'autre chose que le produit:

\begin{itemize}

\item formation, conseil

\item publicit{\'e} (comme sur le web)

\item spin-off products

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Avantages de l'open design}

\begin{itemize}

\item meilleurs produits: le d{\'e}veloppement b{\'e}n{\'e}ficie de l'expertise des utilisateurs, qui sont souvent des utilisateurs experts.

\item prix du travail: les contributions sont volontaires et non r{\'e}tribu{\'e}es (c'est moi qui interpr{\`e}te)

\item publicit{\'e}: couverrture m{\'e}dia gratuite et efficace {\`a} travers le r{\'e}seau social que constitue la communaut{\'e} de d{\'e}veloppement

\item mass-customisation des produits

\end{itemize}

In response, product designers seek simple and effective methods for lowering the environmental footprints of their concepts. Design for environment (DfE) is a field of product design methodology that includes tools, methods, and principles to help designers reduce environmental impact. The most powerful and well-known tool for DfE is life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA requires a fully specified design, however, which makes it applicable primarily at the end of the design process. Because the decisions with the greatest environmental impact are made during early design stages when data for a comprehensive LCA are not yet available, it is important to develop DfE tools that can be implemented in the early conceptual and embodiment design stages. Based on a broad critical review of DfE literature and best practices, a set of 76 DfE guidelines are compiled and reconciled for use in early stage design of products with minimal environmental impact. Select guidelines are illustrated through examples, and several strategies for using the guidelines are introduced.},

In this paper we primarily discuss the evolution of ECMPRO that has taken place in the last decade and discuss the new areas that have come into focus during this time. After presenting some background information, the paper systematically investigates the literature by classifying over 540 published references into four major categories, viz., environmentally conscious product design, reverse and closed-loop supply chains, remanufacturing, and disassembly. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the evolution of ECMPRO over the past decade together with the avenues for future research.},

Therefore, in this paper, Design for Multiple Life-Cycles is defined as a combination of eco-design strategies including Design for Environment and Design for Remanufacture, which leads to other design strategies such as Design for Upgrade, Design for Assembly, Design for Disassembly, Design for Modularity, Design for Maintainability and Design for Reliability.

\end{itemize}

Specific to DfE and a given product family

The discovery method is based on reverse engineering and the validation method is based on an analytical approach (LCA)

The other article of Telenko (a compilation of design for environment guidelines) uses literature review as a discovery method

the method presented here is really work intensive and delivers few results. Its usability in practice can be questioned.

The method does not really explains how guidelines are generated (what are the cognitive steps that are required?).

However, the studies indicated the possibility of such models.

The ``private investment'' model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The ``collective action'' model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound ``private-collective'' model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the ``best of both worlds'' under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.},

  abstract = {Distributed manufacturing is rapidly proliferating to citizen level via the use of digital fabrication equipment, especially in dedicated ``makerspaces''. The sustainability benefits of citizens' personal fabrication are commonly endorsed. However, to assess how these maker practitioners actually deal with environmental issues, these practitioners and their practices need to be studied. Moreover research on the environmental issues in personal fabrication is nascent despite the common perception that the digital technologies can become disruptive. The present paper is the first to report on how practitioners assess the environmental sustainability of future practices in this rapidly changing field. It does so through an envisioning workshop with leading-edge makers. The findings show that these makers are well able to envision the future of their field. Roughly 25\% of the issues covered had clear environmental implications. Within these, issues of energy use, recycling, reusing and reducing materials were covered widely by environmentally-oriented participants. In contrast, issues related to emerging technologies, materials and practices were covered by other participants, but their environmental implications remained unaddressed. The authors concluded there is a gap between different maker subcultures in their sustainability orientations and competences. Further research on the environmental aspects of real-life maker practices and personal fabrication technologies now could help avert negative impacts later, as the maker phenomenon spreads. This knowledge should also be directed to developing targeted environmental guidelines and solutions for personal fabrication users, which are currently lacking. Potential also lies in seeking to enhance dialogue between pro-environmental and new-technology-oriented practitioners through shared spaces, workshops and conferences.},

Design heuristics have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12 industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the designers' sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the problem for 25~min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience, environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design domains.},

  abstract = {Design knowledge can be acquired from various sources and generally requires an integrated representation for its effective and efficient re-use. Though knowledge about products and processes can illustrate the solutions created (know-what) and the courses of actions (know-how) involved in their creation, the reasoning process (know-why) underlying the solutions and actions is still needed for an integrated representation of design knowledge. Design rationale is an effective way of capturing that missing part, since it records the issues addressed, the options considered, and the arguments used when specific design solutions are created and evaluated. Apart from the need for an integrated representation, effective retrieval methods are also of great importance for the re-use of design knowledge, as the knowledge involved in designing complex products can be huge. Developing methods for the retrieval of design rationale is very useful as part of the effective management of design knowledge, for the following reasons. Firstly, design engineers tend to want to consider issues and solutions before looking at solid models or process specifications in detail. Secondly, design rationale is mainly described using text, which often embodies much relevant design knowledge. Last but not least, design rationale is generally captured by identifying elements and their dependencies, i.e. in a structured way which opens the opportunity for going beyond simple keyword-based searching. In this paper, the management of design rationale for the re-use of design knowledge is presented. The retrieval of design rationale records in particular is discussed in detail. As evidenced in the development and evaluation, the methods proposed are useful for the re-use of design knowledge and can be generalised to be used for the retrieval of other kinds of structured design knowledge.},

  abstract = {The most important moment in product development is when demands and specifications are decided for the product that is being planned. The specification defines the goal for the product development process. It is a very important steering opportunity for the continuing work and for environmentally driven demands that are to be addressed in the product development phase. The designers are said to have the key to sustainable product development through EcoDesign. Many tools have been developed in order to help them to achieve this objective. However, most tools are seldom used primarily because of a lack of sustainability oriented requirements in specifications for products. If there is no demand for improved environmental performance, then there is no need for EcoDesign tools. The lack of market demand for environmentally improved products is therefore, a crucial factor. In other words: It makes no sense to grab a screwdriver from your toolbox if you have a nail in your hand. On the other hand if you have a hammer in your hand you tend to see everything as nails! The hypothesis of this paper is that there is a strong need for a tool to facilitate the integration of reasonable environmental demands into the product development process. The presented tool, ``The Ten Golden Rules,'' can be helpful in this effort. A helpful tool must be well adapted to the task and therefore it is important that the individual product developer/designer can develop personal versions from the generic guidelines. The Ten Golden Rules provide such a possibility. They provide a common foundation, for all in the team, which can be used as a base and guidelines for development of situation specific product-design challenges.},

Given a database of previous designs, this method identifies relationships between design components within this database. Further, the method transforms these relationships into explicit design knowledge that can be used to generate a `heuristic-based' model of the design domain for use at the conceptual stage. This can be viewed as a knowledge extracting method for the conceptual design stage. Such a method is particularly interesting, as the conceptual stage typically lacks explicit models to describe the trade-offs that must be made when designing. The method uses either principal components analysis or self-organizing maps to identify the relationships, and this paper describes all the elements required by the method to successfully extract and verify design knowledge from design databases.},

The more than sixty guidelines presented in this book are language-independent and allow you to rate the integrity of a software design. The heuristics are not written as hard and fast rules; they are meant to serve as warning mechanisms which allow the flexibility of ignoring the heuristic as necessary. This tutorial-based approach, born out of the author's extensive experience developing software, teaching thousands of students, and critiquing designs in a variety of domains, allows you to apply the guidelines in a personalized manner. The heuristics cover important topics ranging from classes and objects (with emphasis on their relationships including association, uses, containment, and both single and multiple inheritance) to physical object-oriented design. You will gain an understanding of the synergy that exists between design heuristics and the popular concept of design patterns; heuristics can highlight a problem in one facet of a design while patterns can provide the solution. Programmers of all levels will find value in this book. The newcomer will discover a fast track to understanding the concepts of object-oriented programming. At the same time, experienced programmers seeking to strengthen their object-oriented development efforts will appreciate the insightful analysis. In short, with Object-Oriented Design Heuristics as your guide, you have the tools to become a better software developer.},

L'article {\'e}tudie les motivations des participants aux projets de d{\'e}veloppement logiciels open source.

L'article montre que ces mod{\`e}les sont pertinents pour expliquer les motivations des participants aux projets de d{\'e}veloppement open source. On savait donc que les projets open source se r{\'e}calmaient d'une communaut{\'e} (cf. Depoorter pour une critique de ce point), on sait maintenant que les projets d'open source peuvent {\^e}tre consid{\'e}r{\'e}s {\`a} la fois comme \textbf{{\'e}quipe projets spacialement distribu{\'e}es}, \textbf{communaut{\'e}s} et \textbf{mouvement sociaux}.

\textbf{Carct{\'e}ristiques de l'open source:}

\begin{itemize}

\item le gens ne sont pas pay{\'e}s, c'est "for free" (bien que des entreprises peuvent payer leurs employ{\'e}s pour participer {\`a} des projets open source, mais les raisons ne sont pas bien expliqu{\'e}es dans l'article).

\item facilit{\'e} de rejoindre le projet (il faut juste t{\'e}l{\'e}charger les fichiers pour pouvoir les travailler chez soi) et {\'e}galement de le quitter.

\item pas d'organisation formelle du tavail (cf. Demazi{\`e}res pour qui il n'y a pas d'organisation formelle de la communaut{\'e})

\item atteignent des standards de qualit{\'e} qui rivalisent sans rougir avec les solutions propri{\'e}taires. Une hypoth{\`e}se est que l'organisation d{\'e}mocratique (le bazaar de Raymond) assure que seule les meilleures solutions sont accept{\'e}es.

\item le paradigme open source n'est en fait pas jeune, et est partag{\'e}e depuis toujours par la recherche scientifique. Ce paradigme n'est pas guid{\'e} par le gain mais la r{\'e}putation (je rajouterais bien le gout pour la science mais, c'est pas dit dans l'article).

\textbf{Conditions de succ{\`e}s d'un porjet open source}

\begin{itemize}

\item une culture partag{\'e}e dans laquelle l'autorit{\'e} {\'e}mane de la comp{\'e}tence

\item ouverture {\`a} la d{\'e}l{\'e}gation, {\`a} la participation, d{\'e}finition claire des responsabilit{\'e}s

\item structure modulaire du projet

The future of production systems is a big concern in Europe and particularly in France where two national initiatives were started in 2012: a specific ministry of productive recovery and a specific scientific reflexion on research on production systems. A one-year work gave the main ideas for what is significantly moving in production systems to make them sustainable for a long time in a European country. It highlighted three main evolutions that would create the industry of the future quite different to the today manufacturing industry: at first, the production systems would be pulled by the development of the technologies with high added value that emerge from today; Then it was considered that the link of the systems of production and the territories would be a heavy trend of future and thus put forward the evolutions of the organization. Finally, it could be the revival of the social contract that would pull the evolution of the systems of production. The paper relates the first conclusions of this national work.},

  abstract = {Open source software development has received considerable scholarly attention, much of which is based on the presumption that the `open source model' holds some lessons of broader applicability. Nonetheless, our knowledge of its deployment outside the software industry is very limited. This paper focuses on the open source development of tangible objects, the so-called open design. We propose a generalised definition of open source development. Drawing on 27 exploratory interviews and six comparative case studies selected from a pool of more than 75 projects, we analyse the workings of open design. The analysis reveals that open design is already being implemented in a substantial variety of projects with different organisational and institutional structures.},

I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the "cathedral" model, representing most of the commercial world, versus the "bazaar" model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.},

  abstract = {Traditionally the protection of intellectual property is regarded as a precondition for value capture. The rise of open source (OS) software and OS tangible products, so-called open design, has challenged this understanding. Openness is often regarded as a dichotomous variable (open-source vs. closed-source) and it is assumed that online developer communities demand full opening of the product's source. In this paper we will explore openness as a gradual and multi-dimensional concept. We carried out an Internet survey (N = 270) among participants of 20 open design communities in the domain of IT hardware and consumer electronics. We find that open design projects pursue complex strategies short of complete openness and that communities value openness of software more highly than openness of hardware. Our findings suggest that open design companies can successfully implement strategies of partial openness to safeguard value capture without alienating their developer community.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the concept of distributed economies (DE) as a fresh strategy to guide industrial development towards becoming more sustainable. The concept calls for a transformation in the industrial system towards DE departing from the socio-economically and environmentally unsustainable dynamics associated with large-scale, centralised production units that are favoured by neoclassical economic drivers. With DE, a selective share of production is distributed to regions where a diverse range of activities are organised in the form of small-scale, flexible units that are synergistically connected with each other and prioritise quality in their production. However, rather than the total abolishment of large-scale production, our argument concentrates on finding a renewed balance between large- and small-scale and between resource flows that take place within and across regional boundaries. Other desirable characteristics of production units compatible with DE are elaborated. The paper concludes by calling for the deployment of the vast amount of globally and regionally available knowledge for the formation of regionally adapted strategies to create dynamically ``self-organizing'' business environments.},

Additive manufacturing build up parts by adding materials one layer at a time based on a computerized 3D solid model. It does not require the use of fixtures, cutting tools, coolants, and other auxiliary resources. It allows design optimization and the producing of customized parts on-demand. Its advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivated the imagination of the public, reflected in recent mainstream publications that call additive manufacturing ``the third industrial revolution.'' This paper reviews the societal impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspective. Abundance of evidences were found to support the promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas: (1) customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand fulfillment. In the mean time, the review also identified the need for further research in the areas of life-cycle energy consumption evaluation and potential occupation hazard assessment for additive manufacturing.},

As the potential for rationalization and achieving flexibility within companies is to the greatest possible extent exhausted, approaches to the corporate reorganization of value creation are becoming increasingly important. In this process, the spread and further development of information and communication technology often provide the basis for a reorganization of cross-company value nets and lead to a redistribution of roles and tasks between the actors involved in value creation. While cooperative, decentralized and self-organizing value creation processes are in fact being promoted, the associated potential for development and production engineering is being underestimated and hence not implemented sufficiently. This contribution will introduce a value creation taxonomy and then, using its notion and structure, describe the emerging transformations in value creation on the basis of case studies. Finally an adequate framework for analysing and configuring value creation will be presented.},

Second, the hybrid 3D printing-milling machine demonstrates the digitization of material and the potential of digital fabrication.

Against this background, this study focuses on a case study of the development of an automobile. Based on a commons-based peer production-informed perspective, we show that this project displays a variety of characteristics that are usually associated with OSS projects. In particular, parallels can be drawn between the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, the ability to `broadcast' ideas due to the virtual nature of the tasks, and the self-selection of tasks due to their modular nature. The drawing of such parallels, however, must be done cautiously because diverse factors, such as opportunity costs, regulations, and feasibility studies, limit the applicability of OSS principles to this non-software related network of dispersed voluntary contributors within a commons-based peer production framework. Herein, we attempt to clarify how OSS projects can and cannot work as role models for open innovation in the automotive as well as other product-oriented industries.},

  abstract = {Open-X methodologies describe the application of Open Innovation to different stages of the Product-Life-Cycle (PLC). Open Innovation deals with involving external players in a company's innovation process. Those can provide ideas from any stage of the PLC, such as lead users in the development stage or product-users in the utilization stage. These ideas themselves can initiate innovations in any PLC stage. However, this typically affects the development of new products. This means that ideas collected are incorporated into early PLC stages only. There is significant potential in using ideas not only for early stages but also for later stages, which means for existing products. Open-Utilization, as one form of the Open-X methodologies, can create innovations in the form of upgrades or new services for a product. Because respective PLC stages are not equally suitable for Open-X methodologies, this paper presents an assessment concept for evaluating each PLC stage regarding their Open-X capabilities and possible constraints. To illustrate the utility of the assessment concept, this paper identifies two PLC stages which demonstrate exemplary capacity for Open-X methodologies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer\textendash{}producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for `distributed production' to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.},

  abstract = {In recent years, more and more consumer goods firms have started to tap into the creative potential of their user communities to fuel their new product development pipelines. Although many have hailed this paradigm shift as a highly promising development for firms, hardly any research has systematically compared the actual market performance of user-generated products with designer-generated ones. We fill this void by presenting a unique data set gathered from the Japanese consumer goods brand Muji, which has drawn on both sources of ideas in parallel in recent years. We demonstrate that user-generated products, which are found to generally contain higher novelty, outperformed their designer-generated counterparts on key market performance metrics. Specifically, in the first year after introduction, sales revenues from user-generated products were three times higher and gross margins were four times greater than those of designer-generated products. These effects also increased over time: after three years, the aggregate sales revenues of user-generated products were, on average, 1.25 billion yen (approximately 16 million dollars) higher, or five times greater, than the sales of designer-generated products. The corresponding average margin was an impressive 619 million yen (approximately 8 million dollars) higher, or six times greater, than the margin for designer-generated products. Finally, user-generated products were more likely to survive the three-year observation period than designer-generated products (i.e., were still on the market three years after introduction). These findings clearly favor the paradigm shift identified in marketing research and appeal to managers considering the integration of user ideas into the process of new product development. We discuss our study's limitations and identify important avenues for future research.},

The outcome is based on a TNS Infratest panel, which is representative of Germany's online population. The selected sample size reached n=504 respondents.The results of the study address three central questions:1.     Who participates online today?We are interested in the distribution of sociodemographic (gender and age distribution) and socioeconomic (income distribution, educational background and current employment status) characteristics within user groups.Our results show that internet users between the ages of 18 and 36, especially those with a university degree are the most active online participants.2.     What do the users do and what interests them?Regarding the inquired participation forms, we indicate the frequency of usage, the width and intensity of online activities performed, and the individual level of interest in their respective participation forms. Our findings demonstrate that signing an e-petition, has become a very popular form of political and social online participation. Overall, the amount of time respondents dedicate to online participation demonstrates a high level of engagement.3.	What motivations and incentives are behind online participation?In the third part, we examine what triggers online participation on the basis of action-oriented, outcome-oriented, and consequence-oriented motivations. Based on the answers given by respondents, five different user groups were identified by similar incentive structures. Creativity and self-efficacy were central personality characteristics noted in the study. The results show that the more users engage in participation forms, the more empowered and creative they feel.},

So it makes good business sense for companies to develop the capability to innovate their business models.

This paper explores the barriers to business model innovation, which previous academic research has identified as including conflicts with existing assets and business models, as well as cognition in understanding these barriers. Processes of experimentation and effectuation, and the successful leadership of organizational change must be brought to bear in order to overcome these barriers. Some examples of business model innovation are provided to underline its importance, in hopes of inspiring managers and academics to take these challenges on.},

We build on the RCOV framework - itself inspired by a Penrosian view of the firm \textendash{} to try to reconcile these two approaches to consider business model evolution, looking particularly at the dynamic created by interactions between its business model's components. We illustrate our framework with the case of the English football club Arsenal FC over the last decade.

  abstract = {Every company's ability to innovate depends on a process of experimentation whereby new products and services are created and existing ones improved. But the cost of experimentation often limits innovation. New technologies\textemdash{}including computer modeling and simulation\textemdash{}promise to lift that constraint by changing the economics of experimentation. Never before has it been so economically feasible to ask "what-if" questions and generate preliminary answers. These technologies amplify the impact of learning, paving the way for higher R\&D performance and innovation and new ways of creating value for customers.In Experimentation Matters, Stefan Thomke argues that to unlock such potential, companies must not only understand the power of experimentation and new technologies, but also change their processes, organization, and management of innovation. He explains why experimentation is so critical to innovation, underscores the impact of new technologies, and outlines what managers must do to integrate them successfully. Drawing on a decade of research in multiple industries as diverse as automotive, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and banking, Thomke provides striking illustrations of how companies drive strategy and value creation by accommodating their organizations to new experimentation technologies.As in the outcome of any effective experiment, Thomke also reveals where that has not happened, and explains why. In particular, he shows managers how to: implement "front-loaded" innovation processes that identify potential problems before resources are committed and design decisions locked in; experiment and test frequently without overloading their organizations; integrate new technologies into the current innovation system; organize for rapid experimentation; fail early and often, but avoid wasteful "mistakes"; and manage projects as experiments.Pointing to the custom integrated circuit industry\textemdash{}a multibillion dollar market\textemdash{}Thomke also shows what happens when new experimentation technologies are taken beyond firm boundaries, thereby changing the way companies create new products and services with customers and suppliers. Probing and thoughtful, Experimentation Matters will influence how both executives and academics think about experimentation in general and innovation processes in particular. Experimentation has always been the engine of innovation, and Thomke reveals how it works today.},

Defying conventional wisdom on the negative effects of uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly reveal their innovations to competing users and to manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers are in a position to refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users' decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings.},

The purpose of this article is to address the following research question: what are the main strategic difficulties encountered by firms whose business models rely on public Web communities to create value? This study used a collaborative research approach, and the empirical data is based on the longitudinal strategic analysis of a Web start-up, CrowdSpirit, a collaborative Web-based platform which enables communities to imagine and design innovative products. The authors suggest that crowdsourcing platforms act as intermediaries in multi-sided markets and, as such, are at the core of a knowledge-sharing and IP transfer process between multiple actors.

While most research has previously focused on typologies or challenges of open business models, their specific antecedents have not been studied so far. We use data from eight open business model cases to explore this question and identify five main antecedents of open business models: (1) business model inconsistency, (2) need to create and capture new value, (3) previous experience with collaboration, (4) open business model patterns, and (5) industry convergence. Based on openness characteristics from the existing literature, we differentiate four basic types of open business models and develop an initial understanding of the relevance of the identified antecedents for each of them. We thereby provide first guidelines for practitioners in choosing the right form of business model openness for their company.},

A theoretical framework incorporating our point of view on the concepts of knowledge, collaborative design and argumentation is presented, to justify the design experiment situation we constructed. The empirical study that was carried out is then presented with a description of the situation through the proposed task, the participants, the tools they used, the steps they took, the instructions given to them, the resources put at their disposal and the deliverables expected from them.

  abstract = {Eco-innovations, eco-efficiency and corporate social responsibility practices define much of the current industrial sustainability agenda. While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability?

Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage.

Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation.

Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice. The archetypes are: Maximise material and energy efficiency; Create value from `waste'; Substitute with renewables and natural processes; Deliver functionality rather than ownership; Adopt a stewardship role; Encourage sufficiency; Re-purpose the business for society/environment; and Develop scale-up solutions.},

In doing so, I address the questions of what (the content of open innovation), when (the context dependency) and how (the process). Open innovation is a rich concept, that can be implemented in many different ways. The context dependency of open innovation is one of the least understood topics; more research is needed on the internal and external environment characteristics affecting performance. The open innovation process relates to both the transition towards open innovation, and the various open innovation practices.

As with any new concept, initial studies focus on successful and early adopters, are based on case studies, and descriptive. However, not all lessons learned from the early adopters may be applicable to following firms. Case study research increases our understanding of how things work and enables us to identify important phenomena. They should be followed by quantitative studies involving large samples to determine the relative importance of factors, to build path models to understand chains of effects, and to formally test for context dependencies. However, the evidence shows that open innovation has been a valuable concept for so many firms and in so many contexts, that it is on its way to find its final place in innovation management.},

However, we argue that implementation of these predictions is hampered by prevailing project accounting systems which distorts the economic effects of modularization at the level of the individual product. This has the implication that decisions on modularization can only be made by top management if decision authority and relevant information are to be aligned. To overcome this problem, we suggest a solution that aligns the descriptions of the economic consequences of modularization at the project and portfolio level which makes it possible to decentralize decision making while making sure that local goals are congruent with the global ones in order to avoid suboptimal behaviour.},

This paper investigates designers' approaches when selecting inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process. We conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design Masters students while generating ideas for a design problem. The results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require different levels of cognitive effort, depending on whether there is unlimited or limited access to stimuli. Furthermore, three important stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition, stimuli search and stimuli selection. For each of these stages, we elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they use and what drives their selection of stimuli. This paper contributes to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their inspiration process in a more detailed manner.},

  abstract = {Several design practitioners claim to follow an open design philosophy, using open sourcing material, models or tools. But there has been little work on framing the properties of artifacts produced that way, nor on studying how " openness " influence design processes (Aitamurto, Holland \& Hussain, 2015). In this paper, we propose to investigate Open Design through examples of prosthetic hands. These highly specific and personalized devices have to answer highly sensitive social, personal, subjective and functional requirements. They perfectly illustrate the challenges the Open Paradigm may help tackling, such as greater inclusivity through the reduction of stigma, access to social participation and empowerment of users in general. First, we build upon the related work to identify properties of openness. We then present the methodology used to review nine different prosthetic hands. Building upon these examples, we frame a critical perspective on openness and how this paradigm encompasses or informs other design practices. We conclude by presenting our current and future work, to provide perspectives on the applications of our essay.},

This is a simple and unobtrusive software tool that allows engineering designers to record their rationale as the design proceeds.

Thus it allows the issues addressed, options considered, plus associated pro and con arguments, to be captured in the form of a directed graph of dependencies. The research was conducted in close collaboration with, deployed, and tested in a major multinational aerospace company. The paper describes the main features of the tool, by means of a real design example from the company. It then examines the methodology and process by which the tool was researched, implemented and introduced into industrial practice. Finally, DRed is compared with other IBIS-based software, to identify and explain how it addresses problems that seem to have made earlier tools unsuitable for routine use by designers. Simplicity seems to be a key factor for real world acceptance of such tools.},

  abstract = {You can create the next breakthrough innovation. A revolution is under way. But it's not about tearing down the old guard. It's about building, it's about creating, it's about breathing life into groundbreaking new ideas. It's called the Maker Movement, and it's changing the world. Mark Hatch has been at the forefront of the Maker Movement since it began. A cofounder of TechShop - the first, largest, and most popular maker space - Hatch has seen it all. Average people pay a small fee for access to advanced tools - everything from laser cutters and milling machines to 3D printers and AutoCAD software. All they have to bring is their creativity and some positive energy. Prototypes of new products that would have cost \$100,000 in the past have been made in his shop for \$1,000.  The Maker Movement is where all the next great inventions and innovations are happening - and you can play a part in it. The Maker Movement Manifesto takes you deep into the movement. Hatch describes the remarkable technologies and tools now accessible to you and shares stories of how ordinary people have devised extraordinary products, giving rise to successful new business ventures. He explains how economic upheavals are paving the way for individuals to create, innovate, make a fortune - and even drive positive societal change - with nothing more than their own creativity and some hard work. It's all occurring right now, all around the world - and possibly in your own neighborhood. The creative spirit lives inside every human being. We are all makers. Whether you're a banker, lawyer, teacher, tradesman, or politician, you can play an important role in the Maker society. So fire up your imagination, read The Maker Movement Manifesto - and start creating! Praise for The Maker Movement Manifesto: "It's the same revolutionary innovation model, but now applied to one of the biggest industries in the world-manufacturing." (Chris Anderson, CEO, 3D Robotics, and former Editor-in-Chief, Wired). "He (Henry Ford) probably would have started in TechShop." (Bill Ford, Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company, and great-grandson of Henry Ford). "We are heading into a new age of manufacturing...Hatch has a front-row seat and has written the must-follow guide to democratize this new age. This is the book I wish every American would use. It contains the keys to the future of work and joy for everyone." (Robert Scoble, Startup Liaison Officer, Rackspace). "TechShop is the garage that Thomas Edison wished he had, and thanks to Mark Hatch, it's open it to the public. This book is a lifeline to a country with a skills gap that threatens to swallow us all. For aspiring inventors and entrepreneurs, The Maker Movement Manifesto is a 'celebration in the making' - even if the only thing you make is a mess." (Mike Rowe, Dirty Jobs). "Mark's book is pitch-perfect on why the Maker Movement is so important for our collective future." (Beth Comstock, CMO and SVP, GE).},

By comparing and contrasting the Linux model with the traditional/commercial model of software development and firmbased knowledge creation efforts, we show how the proposed model of knowledge creation expands beyond the boundary of the firm. Our model suggests that the product development process can be effectively organized as an evolutionary process of learning driven by criticism and error correction. We conclude by offering some theoretical implications of our community-based model of knowledge creation for the literature of organizational learning, community life, and the uses of knowledge in society.},

  abstract = {With over 10 million git repositories, GitHub is becoming one of the most important sources of software artifacts on the Internet. Researchers mine the information stored in GitHub's event logs to understand how its users employ the site to collaborate on software, but so far there have been no studies describing the quality and properties of the available GitHub data. We document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the characteristics of the repositories and users in GitHub; we see how users take advantage of GitHub's main features and how their activity is tracked on GitHub and related datasets to point out misalignment between the real and mined data. Our results indicate that while GitHub is a rich source of data on software development, mining GitHub for research purposes should take various potential perils into consideration. For example, we show that the majority of the projects are personal and inactive, and that almost 40 \% of all pull requests do not appear as merged even though they were. Also, approximately half of GitHub's registered users do not have public activity, while the activity of GitHub users in repositories is not always easy to pinpoint. We use our identified perils to see if they can pose validity threats; we review selected papers from the MSR 2014 Mining Challenge and see if there are potential impacts to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in GitHub.},

As the community continues to deepen in its understanding of software engineering thanks to the analysis performed on this platform, we believe it is worthwhile to reflect how research papers have addressed the task of mining GitHub repositories over the last years. In this regard, we present a meta-analysis of 93 research papers which addresses three main dimensions of those papers: i) the empirical methods employed, ii) the datasets they used and iii) the limitations reported. Results of our meta-analysis show some concerns regarding the dataset collection process and size, the low level of replicability, poor sampling techniques, lack of longitudinal studies and scarce variety of methodologies.},

In this paper, we analyze a set of 89 top-starred GitHub projects and their forks in order to explore the nature and distribution of such community contribution. We first classify commits (and developers) into three categories: core, external and mutant, and study the relative sizes of each of these classes through a ring-based visualization. We observe that projects written in mainstream scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python tend to include more external participation than projects written in upcoming languages such as Scala. We also visualize the geographic spread of these communities via geocoding. Finally, we classify the types of pull requests submitted based on their labels and observe that bug fixes are more likely to be merged into the main projects as compared to feature enhancements.},

  abstract = {We are now witnessing the rapid growth of decentralized source code management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository. DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators, rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

This new generation of version control supports two important new features: distributed repositories and histories that preserve branches and merges. Through interviews with lead developers in OSS projects and a quantitative analysis of mined data from the histories of sixty project, we find that the vast majority of the projects now using DVC continue to use a centralized model of code sharing, while using branching much more extensively than before their transition to DVC. We then examine the Linux history in depth in an effort to understand and evaluate how branches are used and what benefits they provide. We find that they enable natural collaborative processes: DVC branching allows developers to collaborate on tasks in highly cohesive branches, while enjoying reduced interference from developers working on other tasks, even if those tasks are strongly coupled to theirs.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years the number of methods for Eco-design increased dramatically. LCA in Eco-assessment has established itself as a reference methodology and with it some tools that reached an international resonance. On the contrary, in the Eco-improvement world, the growth of methods has not been accompanied by a method or a tool better than other ones. One of the main reasons is the different type of users; there are people skilled in problem solving and those who have no experience. In addition, in order to be universal, the methods based on guidelines often do not go into too much detail, thus limiting their effectiveness. The balance between completeness and simplicity is the key issue around which the authors have attempted in recent years.In such a context, this paper aims at solving this contradiction and proposes an ontological framework to build guidelines for eco-improvements. Their content has been structured into five parts, according to well-known conceptual design frameworks, such as Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) methods and similar.The result is a set of over than two hundreds suggestions that can be comfortably used through a web portal following a recommended step-by-step methodological path.},

However, these characterizations are vague, because there is no consistent definition of what is a small or a large commit. In this paper, we study the nature of commits in two dimensions. First, we define the size of commits in terms of number of files, and then we classify commits based on the content of their comments.

  abstract = {One of the challenges in 3D shape matching arises from the fact that in many applications, models should be considered to be the same if they differ by a rotation. Consequently, when comparing two models, a similarity metric implicitly provides the measure of similarity at the optimal alignment. Explicitly solving for the optimal alignment is usually impractical. So, two general methods have been proposed for addressing this issue: (1) Every model is represented using rotation invariant descriptors. (2) Every model is described by a rotation dependent descriptor that is aligned into a canonical coordinate system defined by the model. In this paper, we describe the limitations of canonical alignment and discuss an alternate method, based on spherical harmonics, for obtaining rotation invariant representations. We describe the properties of this tool and show how it can be applied to a number of existing, orientation dependent descriptors to improve their matching performance. The advantages of this tool are two-fold: First, it improves the matching performance of many descriptors. Second, it reduces the dimensionality of the descriptor, providing a more compact representation, which in turn makes comparing two models more efficient.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

  doi = {10.3115/1075096.1075150},
  abstract = {We demonstrate that an unlexicalized PCFG can parse much more accurately than previously shown, by making use of simple, linguistically motivated state splits, which break down false independence assumptions latent in a vanilla treebank grammar. Indeed, its performance of 86.36\% (LP/LR F1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize.},

The guideline provides a better evaluation of manufacturing processes, assembly, maintenance, capability and human factors (ergonomics). It is expected to improve the manufacturing and simplify the assembly to become easier the manufacturing of parts that will make the aircraft final assembly with low costs, high quality and the best optimized condition. A case study is showed to testify the advantages and benefits achieved when the proposed tool is used.},

The problem of forming a ``dream'' team involves many variables, including consideration of human factors, and it is not a dilemma solvable in a mathematical way. Empirical studies might provide interesting insights to explain which factors need to be taken into account in building a team of developers and which levers act to optimise collaboration and productivity among developers. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study aimed at investigating the link between team diver- sity (i.e., gender, nationality) and productivity (issue fixing time). We consider issues solved from the GHTorrent dataset inferring gender and nationality of each team's members. We also evaluate the politeness of all comments involved in issue resolution. Results show that higher gender diversity is linked with a lower team average issue fixing time and that nationality diversity is linked with lower team politeness.},

  shorttitle = {Engineering {{Design}}},
  abstract = {Engineering design must be carefully planned and systematically executed. In particular, engineering design methods must integrate the many different aspects of designing and the priorities of the end-user. Engineering Design (3rd edition) describes a systematic approach to engineering design. The authors argue that such an approach, applied flexibly and adapted to a particular task, is essential for successful product development. The design process is first broken down into phases and then into distinct steps, each with its own working methods. The third edition of this internationally-recognised text is enhanced with new perspectives and the latest thinking. These include extended treatment of product planning; new sections on organisation structures, simultaneous engineering, leadership and team behaviour; and updated chapters on quality methods and estimating costs. New examples have been added and existing ones extended, with additions on design to minimise wear, design for recycling, mechanical connections, mechatronics, and adaptronics. Engineering Design (3rd edition) is translated and edited from the sixth German edition by Ken Wallace, Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Cambridge, and Luci{\"e}nne Blessing, Professor of Engineering Design and Methodology at the Technical University of Berlin. Topics covered include: fundamentals; product planning and product development; task clarification and conceptual design; embodiment design rules, principles and guidelines; mechanical connections, mechatronics and adaptronics; size ranges and modular products; quality methods; and cost estimation methods. The book provides a comprehensive guide to successful product development for practising designers, students, and design educators. Fundamentals are emphasised throughout and short-term trends avoided; so the approach described provides a sound basis for design courses that help students move quickly and effectively into design practice. Engineering Design is widely acknowledged to be the most complete available treatise on systematic design methods. In it, each step of the engineering design process and associated best practices are documented. The book has particularly strong sections on design from the functional perspective and on the phase of the process between conceptual and detail design in which most key design decisions are made. The 3rd edition includes new material on project planning and scheduling. Anyone committed to understanding the design process should be familiar with the contents of this book.

Product design is impacted as well: we observe new stakeholders and practices challenging current structured design processes and leading to industrial successes. Open-design appears to be promising yet disruptive. Moreover, its distinctive features remain unclear.
This paper aims to popularize this new concept, as well as to give both researchers and practitioners an overview of current research on open-design, and its consequences on design. For this, we conducted a systematic quantitative bibliometric analysis of 624 entries corresponding to the keyword `open-design' in the Scopus database. This supports a qualitative synthesis of scientific literature, enabling us to summarize practices falling under the umbrella term `open-design'. As such, this paper traces the evolution of product design and the open approach. It also analyzes the impact of open-design on the design process as presented in the scientific literature. Finally, this paper develops a typology of open-design of tangible artifacts that distinguishes among three currently reported varieties of practice: do-it-yourself, meta-design, and industrial ecosystems. As the major contribution of this paper, this typology is developed as a final discussion.},

Recently, the emergence of project ecosystems such as GitHub have created an entirely new, higher level of organization. GitHub supports numerous teams; they share a common technical platform (for work activities) and a common social platform (via following, commenting, etc). We explore the GitHub evidence for socialization as a precursor to joining a project, and how the technical factors of past experience and social factors of past connections to team members of a project affect productivity both initially and in the long run. We find developers preferentially join projects in GitHub where they have pre-existing relationships; furthermore, we find that the presence of past social connections combined with prior experience in languages dominant in the project leads to higher productivity both initially and cumulatively. Interestingly, we also find that stronger social connections are associated with slightly less productivity initially, but slightly more productivity in the long run.},

Developers can thus track the activities relevant to various projects in one umbrella site. Such a major change in collaborative software development makes an investigation of networkings on social coding sites valuable. Furthermore, project hosting platforms promoting this development paradigm have been thriving, among which GitHub has arguably gained the most momentum. In this paper, we contribute to the body of knowledge on social coding by investigating the network structure of social coding in GitHub. We collect 100,000 projects and 30,000 developers from GitHub, construct developer-developer and project-project relationship graphs, and compute various characteristics of the graphs. We then identify influential developers and projects on this sub network of GitHub by using PageRank. Understanding how developers and projects are actually related to each other on a social coding site is the first step towards building tool supports to aid social programmers in performing their tasks more efficiently.},

  doi = {10.1080/09544828.2012.695014},
  abstract = {Within the engineering design literature, dependency modelling techniques have been used to model the structure and evolution of products. While a product's structure has significant implications on the product's quality and the complexity of product development process, recent studies within organisational science suggest that an organisation's structure also has a direct impact on the product structures. This interdependence is particularly important in open-source products developed by communities because there is no community structure imposed at the beginning of the process. Both the product structure and the community structure undergo dynamic co-evolution. Understanding this co-evolution is crucial as open-source development processes are being extended beyond software products to hardware products. To understand the interdependence between product and community structures, empirically testable hypotheses, based on the theory of socio-technical coordination, are formulated in this paper. A dynamic network-based approach is proposed where products are modelled as networks of interfacing modules and communities are modelled as networks of collaborating participants. The proposed approach for testing the hypotheses involves (a) modelling the evolution of networks across consecutive versions and (b) measuring the overlap between anticipated and actual communities. The approach is presented for Drupal, which is an open-source software product. Drupal is chosen due to the availability of product and community data for different versions. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that product structures significantly influence the community structures. However, the impact of community structures on the product structures is weak. While the results are specific to the case study, the approach is general enough to be utilised for other open-source software and hardware products. The approach can also be used to model the evolution of loosely coupled informal communities within traditional organisations.},

  abstract = {This is the raw data set on which the article "What is the source of open source hardware?" to be published in the Journal of Open Hardware under an open access license is based. The abstract of the article is as follows: "What ``open source'' means once applied to tangible products has been so far exclusively addressed through the light of licensing. While this approach is adapted for software, it appears to be over-simplistic for complex hardware products. Whether such a product can be labelled as open source is not only a question of license but also a question of documentation, i.e. what is the information that sufficiently describes it? In other words, what is the ``source'' of open source hardware? To date there is no trivial answer to this question, leaving large room for interpretation in the usage of the term. Based on analysis of public documentation of 132 products, this paper provides an overview of how practitioners tend to interpret the concept of open source hardware. Results empirically confirm the existence of two main usages of the open source principles in the context of tangible products: publication of product-related documentation as a means to support community-based product development and to disseminate privately developed innovations. It also underlines the high variety of interpretations and even misuses of the concept of open source hardware. This reveals in turn that this concept may not even be clear to practitioners and calls for more narrowed down definitions of what has to be shared for a product to be called open source. Results gained by the analysis of current publication practice are summarized in the definition of an open source hardware lifecycle to contribute towards this effort."},

  abstract = {An sss stage kkk name snowball sampling procedure is defined as follows: A random sample of individuals is drawn from a given finite population. (The kind of random sample will be discussed later in this section.) Each individual in the sample is asked to name kkk different individuals in the population, where kkk is a specified integer; for example, each individual may be asked to name his "kkk best friends," or the "kkk individuals with whom he most frequently associates," or the "kkk individuals whose opinions he most frequently seeks," etc. (For the sake of simplicity, we assume throughout that an individual cannot include himself in his list of kkk individuals.) The individuals who were not in the random sample but were named by individuals in it form the first stage. Each of the individuals in the first stage is then asked to name kkk different individuals. (We assume that the question asked of the individuals in the random sample and of those in each stage is the same and that kkk is the same.) The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first stage but were named by individuals who were in the first stage form the second stage. Each of the individuals in the second stage is then asked to name kkk different individuals. The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first or second stages but were named by individuals who were in the second stage form the third stage. Each of the individuals in the third stage is then asked to name kkk different individuals. This procedure is continued until each of the individuals in the sssth stage has been asked to name kkk different individuals. The data obtained using an sss stage kkk name snowball sampling procedure can be utilized to make statistical inferences about various aspects of the relationships present in the population. The relationships present, in the hypothetical situation where each individual in the population is asked to name kkk different individuals, can be described by a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the members of the population, rows for the individuals naming and columns for the individuals named, where the entry \texttheta{}ij\texttheta{}ij$\backslash$theta\_\{ij\} in the iiith row and jjjth column is 1 if the iiith individual in the population includes the jjjth individual among the kkk individuals he would name, and it is 0 otherwise. While the matrix of the \texttheta\texttheta$\backslash$theta's cannot be known in general unless every individual in the population is interviewed (i.e., asked to name kkk different individuals), it will be possible to make statistical inferences about various aspects of this matrix from the data obtained using an sss stage kkk name snowball sampling procedure. For example, when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1, the number, M11M11M\_\{11\}, of mutual relationships present in the population (i.e., the number of values iii with \texttheta{}ij=\texttheta{}ji=1\texttheta{}ij=\texttheta{}ji=1$\backslash$theta\_\{ij\} = $\backslash$theta\_\{ji\} = 1 for some value of j$>$ij$>$ij $>$ i) can be estimated. The methods of statistical inference applied to the data obtained from an sss stage kkk name snowball sample will of course depend on the kind of random sample drawn as the initial step. In most of the present paper, we shall suppose that a random sample (i.e., the "zero stage" in snowball sample) is drawn so that the probability, ppp, that a given individual in the population will be in the sample is independent of whether a different given individual has appeared. This kind of sampling has been called binomial sampling; the specified value of ppp (assumed known) has been called the sampling fraction [4]. This sampling scheme might also be described by saying that a given individual is included in the sample just when a coin, which has a probability ppp of "heads," comes up "heads," where the tosses of the coin from individual to individual are independent. (To each individual there corresponds an independent Bernoulli trial determining whether he will or will not be included in the sample.) This sampling scheme differs in some respects from the more usual models where the sample size is fixed in advance or where the ratio of the sample size to the population size (i.e., the sample size-population size ratio) is fixed. For binomial sampling, this ratio is a random variable whose expected value is ppp. (The variance of this ratio approaches zero as the population becomes infinite.) In some situations (where, for example, the variance of this ratio is near zero), mathematical results obtained for binomial sampling are sometimes quite similar to results obtained using some of the more usual sampling models (see [4], [7]; compare the variance formulas in [3] and [5]); in such cases it will often not make much difference, from a practical point of view, which sampling model is utilized. (In Section 6 of the present paper some results for snowball sampling based on an initial sample of the more usual kind are obtained and compared with results presented in the earlier sections of this paper obtained for snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample.) For snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample, and with s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1, so that each individual asked names just one other individual and there is just one stage beyond the initial sample, Section 2 of this paper discusses unbiased estimation of M11M11M\_\{11\}, the number of pairs of individuals in the population who would name each other. One of the unbiased estimators considered (among a certain specified class of estimators) has uniformly smallest variance when the population characteristics are unknown; this one is based on a sufficient statistic for a simplified summary of the data and is the only unbiased estimator of M11M11M\_\{11\} based on that sufficient statistic (when the population characteristics are unknown). This estimator (when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1) has a smaller variance than a comparable minimum variance unbiased estimator computed from a larger random sample when s=0s=0s = 0 and k=1k=1k = 1 (i.e., where only the individuals in the random sample are interviewed) even where the expected number of individuals in the larger random sample (s=0,k=1)(s=0,k=1)(s = 0, k = 1) is equal to the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1 (i.e., the sum of the expected number of individuals in the initial sample and the maximum expected number of individuals in the first stage). In fact, the variance of the estimator when s=0s=0s = 0 and k=1k=1k = 1 is at least twice as large as the variance of the comparable estimator when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1 even where the expected number of individuals studied when s=0s=0s = 0 and k=1k=1k = 1 is as large as the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1. Thus, for estimating M11M11M\_\{11\}, the sampling scheme with s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1 is preferable to the sampling scheme with s=0s=0s = 0 and k=1k=1k = 1. Furthermore, we observe that when s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1 the unbiased estimator based on the simplified summary of the data having minimum variance when the population characteristics are unknown can be improved upon in cases where certain population characteristics are known, or where additional data not included in the simplified summary are available. Several improved estimators are derived and discussed. Some of the results for the special case of s=k=1s=k=1s = k = 1 are generalized in Sections 3 and 4 to deal with cases where sss and kkk are any specified positive integers. In Section 5, results are presented about sss stage kkk name snowball sampling procedures, where each individual asked to name kkk different individuals chooses kkk individuals at random from the population. (Except in Section 5, the numbers \texttheta{}ij\texttheta{}ij$\backslash$theta\_\{ij\}, which form the matrix referred to earlier, are assumed to be fixed (i.e., to be population parameters); in Section 5, they are random variables. A variable response error is not considered except in so far as Section 5 deals with an extreme case of this.) For social science literature that discusses problems related to snowball sampling, see [2], [8], and the articles they cite. This literature indicates, among other things, the importance of studying "social structure and...the relations among individuals" [2].},

  abstract = {Mass collaboration efforts can increase innovation and design possibilities. Incorporation of open innovation into the product development process allows for a vast array of unique perspectives and ideas. However, with the broad expansion of design possibilities, coordination of these development processes is paramount. To best make use of open innovation in product development, increased organizational efforts must be considered. The mass collaboration of individuals must account for individual intellectual abilities (competencies), working experience and even personality traits or idiosyncrasies. Approaches to this problem require the fusion of social network analysis with quantifiable design impacts. This work proposes a simulation framework that evaluates the design potential of a project team based on individual attributes and the team network structure. The overall contribution of this work comes from the exploration of team structure, focusing on network composition metrics such as centrality and network density, while attempting to understand the role of individual ability and positioning on the success of the design process. This work aims to garner a more thorough understanding of how the network structure of design teams correlates with their potential performance through a generalized simulation framework, applicable to future crowd and design initiatives.},

  abstract = {Social media have recently been introduced into the arena of collaborative design as a new means for seamlessly gathering, processing, and sharing product design-related information. As engineering design processes are becoming increasingly distributed and collaborative, it is crucial to understand the communication and collaboration mechanism of engineers participating in such dispersed engineering processes. In particular, mapping initially disconnected design individuals and teams into an explicit social network is challenging. The objective of this paper is to propose a generic framework for investigating communication and collaboration mechanisms in social media-supported engineering design environments. Specifically, we propose an approach for measuring tie strengths in the context of distributed and collaborative design. We transform an implicit design network into an explicit and formal social network based on specific indices of tie strengths. We visualize the process of transforming customer needs to functional requirements, to design parameters, and to process variables using social network analysis (SNA). Specifically, by utilizing a specific index for tie strengths, we can quantitatively measure tie strengths in a design network. Based on the tie strengths, we can map an implicit design network into an explicit social network. Further, using the typical measures (e.g., centrality and cluster coefficient) in SNA, we can analyze the social network at both actor and systems levels and detect design communities with common design interests. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by means of two examples. The contribution in this paper is a systematic and formal approach that helps gain new insights into communication and collaboration mechanisms in distributed and collaborative design.},

In this paper, designer's bidirectional behavior of task selection integrating passive selection based on website recommendation and autonomous selection is modeled. First, the model of passive selection behavior by website recommendation is proposed with application of collaborative filtering algorithm, based on a three-dimensional matrix including information of design agents, tasks, and skills; second, the model of autonomous selection behavior is described in consideration of factors such as skill and incentive; third, the model of bidirectional selection behavior is described integrating the aforementioned two selection algorithms. At last, contrast simulation analysis of bidirectional selection, passive selection based on website recommendation, and autonomous selection is proposed with ANOVA, and results show that task selection behavior has significant effect on OSD evolution process and that bidirectional selection behavior is more effective to shorten evolution cycle according to the experiment settings. In addition, the simulation study testifies the model of bidirectional selection by describing the task selection process of OSD in microperspective.},

  abstract = {The pattern of information flow through the network of interdependent design activities is thought to be an important determinant of engineering design process results. A previously unexplored aspect of such patterns relates to the temporal dynamics of information transfer between activities as those activities are implemented through the network of people executing the project. To address this gap, we develop a dynamic modeling method that integrates both the network of people and the network of activities in the project. We then employ a large dataset collected from an industrial setting, consisting of project-related e-mails and activity records from the design and development of a renewable energy plant over the course of more than three years. Using network metrics for centrality and clustering, we make three important contributions: 1) We demonstrate a novel method for analyzing information flows between activities in complex engineering design projects; 2) we show how the network of information flows in a large-scale engineering project evolved over time and how network analysis yields several managerial insights; and 3) we provide a useful new representation of the engineering design process and thus support theory-building toward the evolution of information flows through systems engineering stages. Implications include guidance on how to analyze and predict information flows as well as better planning of information flows in engineering design projects according to their individual stage and activity characteristics.},

In order to explore the temporal dynamics of GitHub communities we formulate a time series clustering model using both Social Network Analysis (SNA) and technical metrics. By applying an adaptive time frame incremental approach to clustering, we locate contributors in different temporal networks. We demonstrate our approach on five long-lived OSS projects involving more than 700 contributors and found that there are three main temporal shapes of attention when contributors shift from periphery to core. Our analyses provide insights into common temporal patterns of the growing OSS communities on GitHub and broaden the understanding of the dynamics and motivation of open source contributors.},

  abstract = {The commercial success of open source software, along with a broader socio-cultural shift towards participation in media and cultural production, have inspired attempts to extend and expand open source practices. These include expansions from software into general culture through `Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader `open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to `open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source ...},

General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and Development, an independent committee of twenty-two members, headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Prime Minister of Norway. Designed to examine global environment and development to the year 2000 and beyond, the commission seeks to reassess critical problems, to formulate realistic proposals for solving them, and to raise the level of understanding and commitment to the issues of environment and development. Rather than presenting a gloom and doom report about the destruction of natural resources, Our Common Future offers an agenda advocating the growth of economies based on policies that do not harm, and can even enhance, the environment. The commission recognizes that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, in order to ensure the growth of human progress through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations.},

The total weight of secondary fossil fuel and chemical inputs to produce and use a single 2-gram 32MB DRAM chip are estimated at 1600 g and 72 g, respectively. Use of water and elemental gases (mainly N2) in the fabrication stage are 32\,000 and 700 g per chip, respectively. The production chain yielding silicon wafers from quartz uses 160 times the energy required for typical silicon, indicating that purification to semiconductor grade materials is energy intensive. Due to its extremely low-entropy, organized structure, the materials intensity of a microchip is orders of magnitude higher than that of ``traditional'' goods. Future analysis of semiconductor and other low entropy high-tech goods needs to include the use of secondary materials, especially for purification.},

Au lieu de voir le syst{\`e}me industriel comme s{\'e}par{\'e} de la Biosph{\`e}re, il est possible de le consid{\'e}rer comme un cas particulier d'{\'e}cosyst{\`e}me.

  abstract = {L'{\'e}co-conception est, depuis peu, une nouvelle probl{\'e}matique, que l'entreprise pourrait bien prendre en compte pour en tirer, {\`a} terme, un avantage concurrentiel. C'est concevoir des produits en ayant consid{\'e}r{\'e}, d{\`e}s leur phase de conception, tous les impacts environnementaux qu'ils pourront engendrer sur l'ensemble de leur cycle de vie. Les {\'e}quipes projet ont besoin de s'organiser pour s'approprier le param{\`e}tre environnement n{\'e}cessitant de nouvelles connaissances li{\'e}es {\`a} de nombreuses incertitudes. $<$br /$>$L'objectif principal de ces travaux {\'e}tait donc d'aider {\`a} construire la coh{\'e}rence entre un processus de$<$br /$>$conception et des outils {\`a} disposition des {\'e}quipes. Il s'est agi de : comprendre les diverses acceptions$<$br /$>$possibles de cette nouvelle forme de conception, identifier les principaux enjeux qu'elle repr{\'e}sente pour une entreprise, observer les modes d'organisation au sein de soci{\'e}t{\'e}s pionni{\`e}res dans ce domaine et$<$br /$>$rechercher les outils disponibles. Apr{\`e}s proposition d'un mod{\`e}le de processus d'{\'e}co-conception o{\`u} il importe d'ins{\'e}rer les questions d'environnement dans une d{\'e}marche de conception "classique", nous nous sommes attel{\'e}s {\`a} la classification, la description et la critique de divers outils du panel actuellement {\`a} disposition des {\'e}quipes. Nous avons ainsi identifi{\'e} deux grandes cat{\'e}gories : certains, dits d'{\'e}valuation environnementale(qualitative ou quantitative), et d'autres, dits d'am{\'e}lioration, permettant aux {\'e}quipes d'avancer dans la recherche de nouvelles solutions d'{\'e}co-conception. D'autres outils encore existent en mati{\`e}re de sensibilisation, de communication et de choix de strat{\'e}gies. Chacun d'eux devra {\^e}tre employ{\'e} par un utilisateur appropri{\'e}, disposant des connaissances requises, des moyens d'exploiter les r{\'e}sultats obtenus, et ce, durant certaines phases pertinentes du processus de conception. Une {\'e}tude de terrain chez Philips a permis de constater que la mise {\`a} l'{\'e}preuve d'un outil d'{\'e}valuation environnementale est compromise si les enjeux demeurent incompris et les r{\'e}sultats inexploitables par l'{\'e}quipe projet. A partir d'un engagement fort de la direction, les {\'e}quipes ont besoin d'apprendre progressivement pour s'approprier une nouvelle d{\'e}marche ; au cours de celle-ci, elles pourront utiliser des outils simples, pragmatiques, qu'elles sauront exploiter pour progresser et s'am{\'e}liorer.},
